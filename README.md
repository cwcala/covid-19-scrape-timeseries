covid-19 statistics scraping in Python &amp; Time Series Analysis with ARIMA &amp; PROPHET

Python code to scrape https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ website for the latest covid-19 statistics and make a DataFrame in Pandas for further plotting & analysis.

Python code to import timeseries data from https://github.com/datasets/covid-19 and perform time series forecasts: baseline, ARMIMA, and PROPHET. 

Next steps will be to try in R and on the Exploratory.io and Dataiku platforms for comparative models to increase performance.
